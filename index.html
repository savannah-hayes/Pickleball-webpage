          <h4>What is pickleball?</h4>
          <p class="first-paragraph">
            Pickleball is a paddleball sport that combines elements of
            badminton, table tennis, and tennis. Two or four players use solid
            paddles made of wood or composite materials to hit a perforated
            polymer ball, much like a wiffle ball, but it is more durable, over
            a net. Pickleball is enjoyed by people of all ages and athletic
            abilities thanks to its ease of play and straightforward rules.

          <h4>The rules:</h4>
          <p>
            A pickleball game is played to 11 and must be won by 2. You can only
            score a point while serving. The serve must be hit with an underhand
            swinging motion and the ball contacted below the hips. When the ball
            is served the player on the receiving side must let the ball bounce
            once before hitting it. When the ball is returned to the serving
            side the ball must again bounce once before being hit. After the
            ball has bounced once on each side the ball can be hit without
            bouncing.

          <h4>The court layout:</h4>
          <p>
            A pickleball court is the same size as a doubles badminton court and
            measures 20×44 feet. The net height is 36 inches at the sidelines
            and 34 inches in the middle. The court is striped similar to a
            tennis court with right and left service courts and a 7-foot
            non-volley zone in front of the net (referred to as the “kitchen”).

          <h4>Types of paddles:</h4>
          <p>
            A pickleball paddle is smaller than a tennis racquet but larger than
            a ping-pong paddle, usually measuring between 8 and 15 inches long.
            Originally, they were made of wood, but newer paddles are made of
            lightweight composite materials like aluminum or graphite. The shape
            of a paddle is all about preference when you play.

          <h4>Types of pickleballs:</h4>
          <p>
            Pickleballs are similar to whiffle balls, with holes throughout, but
            they are much more durable. They are about the same size as a
            baseball. Balls are made of plastic and vary based on indoor or
            outdoor use (outdoor pickleballs have smaller holes); they are
            traditionally white or yellow in color.
