        <strong> What is pickleball? </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Pickleball is a paddleball sport (<em>similar to a racquet sport</em>)
        that combines elements of badminton, table tennis, and tennis. Two or
        four players use solid paddles made of wood or composite materials to
        hit a perforated polymer ball, much like a wiffle ball, but it is more
        durable, over a net. A non-volley zone (or kitchen) prevents volleys
        close to the net, and the serving team cannot volley the return of
        serve. Pickleball is enjoyed by people of all ages and athletic
        abilities thanks to its ease of play and straightforward rules.

          <h3>The rules</h3>

          <p style="width: 400px">
            Pickleball can be played as a singles or doubles game, the court and
            rules are the same for both. A pickleball game is normally played to
            11 and must be won by 2. You can only score a point while serving.
            The serve must be hit with an underhand swinging motion and the ball
            contacted below the hips. When hitting the serve the server must be
            behind the baseline and serve into the adjacent service box as is
            done in tennis. When the ball is served the player on the receiving
            side must let the ball bounce once before hitting it. When the ball
            is returned to the serving side the ball must again bounce once
            before being hit. After the ball has bounced once on each side the
            ball can be hit without bouncing.

          <h3>The court layout</h3>

          <p style="width: 400px">
            A pickleball court is the same size as a doubles badminton court and
            measures 20×44 feet. In pickleball, the same court is used for both
            singles and doubles play. The net height is 36 inches at the
            sidelines and 34 inches in the middle. The court is striped similar
            to a tennis court with right and left service courts and a 7-foot
            non-volley zone in front of the net (referred to as the “kitchen”).
            Courts can be constructed specifically for pickleball or they can be
            converted using existing tennis or badminton courts.

          <p style="width: 400px">
            A pickleball paddle is smaller than a tennis racquet but larger than
            a ping-pong paddle, usually measuring between eight and 15 inches
            long. Originally, they were made of wood, but newer paddles are made
            of lightweight composite materials like aluminum or graphite. The
            shape of a pickleball paddle is all about preference when you play.

            Pickleballs are similar to whiffle balls, with holes throughout, but
            they are much more durable. They are about the same size as a
            baseball. Balls are made of plastic and vary based on indoor or
            outdoor use (outdoor pickleballs have smaller holes); they are
            traditionally white or yellow in color.
